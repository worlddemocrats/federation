# World Democrats

Welcome to the main repository of the World Democrats! Our community was born out of the recognition that a new model of governance is urgently needed to address the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Since then, we have been laying the groundwork for a democratic world government that can effectively manage existential risks and harness technological change for the benefit of all.

## Our Current Focus

Currently, we're channeling our efforts into two primary activities:

- **Community building:** We actively partner with organizations and networks that share our vision, and foster a diverse, global community through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KhuwtTPnXa) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/worlddemocrats).
- **Education:** We are running an [academy](https://github.com/worlddemocrats/academy) to provide comprehensive education on topics related to our mission.
