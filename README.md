# World Democrats
Welcome to the World Democrats' main repository! We are an organization dedicated to laying the groundwork for a democratic world government that proactively addresses critical global challenges such as the safe and ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence, pandemics, climate change, and the prevention of nuclear war. We recognize the extraordinary impact of accelerating technological progress and are devoted to managing its risks and harnessing its potential for the greater good of humanity.

Our mission is to unite individuals and communities from across the globe to shape the future of governance. We seek to cultivate a sense of shared responsibility and global citizenship in the pursuit of a just, equitable, and sustainable world where a world government effectively addresses pressing issues and ensures lasting peace, security, and stability. By harnessing the power of collective action, we can build a brighter future for generations to come, safeguard our planet, and uphold democratic values on a global scale.
