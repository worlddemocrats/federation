# World Democrats

Welcome to the main repository of the World Democrats! Our community was born out of the recognition that a new governance model is urgently needed to solve the world's most critical issues. Since then, we have been laying the groundwork for a democratic world government that can effectively manage existential risks and harness technological advancements for the benefit of all.

## Our Current Focus

Our current efforts concentrate on the following key areas:

- **Membership Expansion:** We are determined to build a diverse, global community that shares our vision. We're actively engaging with like-minded organizations and networks, while also fostering participation through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KhuwtTPnXa) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/worlddemocrats).

- **Influence and Leadership:** Our aim is to be a prominent and trusted voice in discussions regarding global governance, existential risks, and technological changes. To this end, we've set up the [World Academy of Politics](https://github.com/worlddemocrats/academy), offering high-quality political education to future leaders.

- **Collaboration and Partnerships:**  Understanding the strength in unity, we're pursuing partnerships with various organizations, institutions, and governments. Our goal is to work together to further the cause of a democratic world government.

- **Financial Stability:** To maintain our capacity to drive our mission forward, we're actively working on diversifying our revenue streams. This includes seeking partnerships and sponsorships that align with our mission and values.
