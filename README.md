# World Democrats

Founded in 2023, the World Democrats was born out of the recognition that a new model of governance is urgently needed to address the complex challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing the implications of accelerating progress, we are dedicated to laying the groundwork for a democratic world government to manage its risks and harness its potential for the benefit of all humanity.
