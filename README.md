# World Democrats

Founded in 2023, the World Democrats emerged in response to the urgent global need for a fresh approach to governance, one capable of addressing the multifaceted and interconnected challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing the extraordinary implications of accelerating change, we are dedicated to laying the groundwork for a democratic world government to manage its risks and harness its potential for the greater good of humanity. Together, we can build a brighter tomorrow, protect our planet, and promote democratic values on a global scale.
