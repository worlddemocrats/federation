# Fundamental Documents of the World Democrats

Welcome to the core repository of the Federation! Our community was born out of the recognition that effective management of existential risks urgently requires globally enforceable regulations, and that a future superintelligence should not be controlled by a small group of people. Since then, we have been laying the foundations for a democratic world government to harness technological progress for the benefit of all.

*Please note that the documents in this repository are works in progress, capturing a snapshot of our current thinking and will continue to evolve to incorporate the collective wisdom and insights of our community. This is a collaborative journey, and we invite and highly value your input and your constructive criticism.*

## Our Current Focus

We are currently working on the following key areas:

- **Membership Expansion:** We're crafting a comprehensive recruitment strategy to grow a diverse, global community.
- **Influence and Leadership:** We are establishing the [World Academy of Politics](https://github.com/worlddemocrats/academy), providing educational programs for future leaders.
- **Collaboration and Partnerships:** We're reaching out to potential partners to unify efforts for a democratic world government.
- **Financial Stability:** We're seeking alliances with philanthropic entities and initiating a fundraising campaign to diversify and stabilize our revenue streams.
