# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Contribution Guide of the World Democrats! We value your time and effort in helping us establish a democratic world government. This guide is designed to facilitate your participation and ensure that your contributions align with our community standards and objectives.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with the content of the repository, particularly the [vision and mission statement](VISION_AND_MISSION.md), [organizational culture](ORGANIZATIONAL_CULTURE.md), and [strategic plan](STRATEGIC_PLAN.md). Understanding these documents will give you insight into our goals and the type of contributions we're looking for.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to our repository involves adding new ideas, engaging in discussions, and improving our existing documentation. Here's how you can participate:

1. **Suggest new documents or major amendments:** If you have an idea for a new document or a significant revision to an existing one, you can propose these changes via a pull request. Start by creating an issue in our repository outlining your proposal. Include as much detail as possible, explaining the purpose of the document or the nature of the changes you want to make. Once the issue is discussed and there is a consensus to proceed, you can create a pull request with your proposed changes.

2. **Engage in discussions:** Participate in conversations within the issues section of our repository. Your insights, questions, or suggestions for improvements are valuable and can lead to meaningful changes in our documentation.

3. **Propose minor edits:** If you spot small issues in our documents, like typos, grammatical errors, or sections that could be clearer, you can suggest these changes via a pull request. For these minor changes, you can directly create a pull request without the need for an initial issue, but please ensure your pull request clearly outlines the changes you've made and the reasons for them.

Remember, every contribution, no matter its size, brings us closer to our mission of fostering a democratic world government.


## Contribution Guidelines

When making contributions, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Respect the Code of Conduct:** All contributions must adhere to our Code of Conduct. We want to foster a respectful and inclusive community.
2. **Clear and concise language:** Please write in clear, concise English. Avoid jargon and complex sentences where possible.
3. **Relevance:** Ensure your contributions are relevant to the document and align with the objectives of the World Democrats community.
4. **Use Markdown:** Our documents are written in Markdown. If you're not familiar with this language, you can find many resources online to get you started. It's easy to learn!

## Review Process

Once you've submitted a contribution, the community will review it. This process ensures that all contributions align with our vision and mission. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Open Discussion:** Members of the community will discuss your contribution. They may ask questions, suggest changes, or express support.
2. **Revision:** Based on the feedback, you may need to revise your contribution. This step is an iterative process and may occur multiple times.
3. **Approval:** If the community reaches a consensus that your contribution is a good fit, it will be approved and merged into the repository.

Please be patient during the review process. We value all contributions and want to give each one the attention it deserves.
