## Article IV â€“ Structure

### Section 1. General Assembly

The General Assembly is the principal democratic organ of the World Democrats, comprising all members of the organization. It holds the ultimate power and responsibility to guide the overall direction and policy of the World Democrats. The General Assembly meets annually for regular sessions and, when necessary, in special sessions, known as Extraordinary General Assemblies.

Members of the General Assembly elect the President, Vice President, and Representative Assembly. They also provide input on the overall strategy, policy matters, and review of the organization's functioning and progress. Furthermore, the General Assembly ratifies constitutional amendments and provides a forum for all members to participate actively in the organization's decision-making process.

### Section 2. Extraordinary General Assembly

An Extraordinary General Assembly can be convened by the President, Representative Assembly, or at least two-thirds of the membership, to address urgent or critical matters requiring immediate resolution or attention. This could include significant changes in global political conditions, emergencies, or other time-sensitive issues that cannot wait until the next scheduled meeting of the General Assembly.

### Section 3. Representative Assembly

The Representative Assembly acts as the legislative body of the World Democrats and is elected by the General Assembly. This assembly has the authority to formulate, debate, and approve policies and strategies. It has a significant role in decision-making and exercises oversight of the Executive Committee's performance.

The Representative Assembly has the power to summon the Chairperson of the Executive Committee for questioning, propose and pass resolutions, and has the right to call for votes of confidence. Furthermore, the Representative Assembly is also responsible for reviewing and approving the annual budget and major initiatives proposed by the Executive Committee.

### Section 4. Factions

Factions within the World Democrats are analogous to political parties, representing different ideological perspectives within the organization. They are essential for fostering diverse viewpoints, encouraging healthy debates, and maintaining a dynamic, pluralistic environment within the organization. Factions have the right to nominate candidates for the Representative Assembly and other organizational positions, propose policies and initiatives, and present unified perspectives during the Representative Assembly's meetings.

### Section 5. Executive Committee

The Executive Committee, similar to a cabinet, is responsible for executing the day-to-day activities of the World Democrats, adhering to the strategies and policies set by the General Assembly and Representative Assembly. It proposes policy changes and presents an annual budget to the Representative Assembly for approval.

This committee ensures the different organizational components function effectively and are in line with the World Democrats' objectives. It also oversees the work of the Secretariat, regional and national chapters, working groups, and committees.

### Section 6. Chairperson of the Executive Committee

The Chairperson of the Executive Committee, analogous to a Prime Minister, leads the execution of the World Democrats' operations. Appointed by the President and approved by the Representative Assembly, they ensure the proper execution of policies, propose new policy changes, and present the annual budget to the Representative Assembly.

The Chairperson is accountable to the Representative Assembly and can be called upon to answer questions, justify decisions, and provide clarity on actions of the Executive Committee.

### Section 7. President and Vice President

The President, as the highest representative of the World Democrats, ensures unity, integrity, and cohesion of the organization's activities. They also oversee inter-organizational relations and have the power to appoint the Chairperson of the Executive Committee, subject to approval by the Representative Assembly.

The Vice President assists the President and assumes the President's responsibilities in their absence or incapacity. The Vice President also plays a crucial role in supporting and facilitating the organization's initiatives, programs, and strategic direction.

### Section 8. Regional and National Chapters

Regional and National Chapters work to implement the World Democrats' objectives at various regional and local levels. They ensure the organization's policies and strategies are executed effectively at different governance levels and maintain regular communication with the Executive Committee. These chapters report their activities, progress, and regional developments to the General Assembly and Executive Committee, ensuring that regional perspectives are well-represented in the organization's strategies.

### Section 9. Working Groups and Committees

Working Groups and Committees are essential for in-depth focus on specific issues, campaigns, or projects. They provide detailed research, analysis, recommendations, and reports to the Representative Assembly and General Assembly. These bodies ensure that specialized attention is given to key areas relevant to the organization's mission.

### Section 10. Secretariat

The Secretariat manages the day-to-day operations and administration of the World Democrats, ensuring that all activities and initiatives are coordinated efficiently. The Secretariat supports the Executive Committee, Representative Assembly, and General Assembly in the execution of their duties and roles.

### Section 11. Youth Wing

The Youth Wing is a critical component of the World Democrats, ensuring that the voices and perspectives of younger members are well-represented within the organization. The Youth Wing contributes to policy discussions, organizes activities focusing on the needs and interests of younger members, and has representation in the Representative Assembly.
